          Welcome to my personal projects site! Here you will find some of the computing projects that I have worked on during my master's degree in physics at University College London, and my bachelor's physics degree at the University of Manchester.
        </p>
        <h2>Physics</h2>
        <h4>Selected assignments from my master's (University College London)</h3>
        <dl class="row">
          <dt class="col-sm-3">MSc Project</dt>
          <dd class="col-sm-9">Constraining new physics with measurements at the LHC.</dd>
        </dl>
        <h4>Selected assignments from my bachelor's (University of Manchester)</h3>
        <dl class="row">
          <dt class="col-sm-3">Probing the CP nature of the Higgs sector <a href="/dissertation.pdf">Read dissertation</a></dt>
          <dd class="col-sm-9">
            BSc dissertation.
          </dd>
          <dt class="col-sm-3">Matter-antimatter asymmetries at the LHC <a href="/cp_violation_charmless_B_k_pi_pi_report.pdf">Read lab report</a></dt>
          <dd class="col-sm-9">
            Third year lab investigating the CP violation of the weak decay of the B meson. 
            The invariant mass of the charged B meson decay to K pi pi was reconstructed and the CP violation of this channel estimated. 
            The two-body resonances of this decay were also studied and the corresponding particles were identified using PDGLive. 
            Dalitz plots of the decay channel were used to show local regions of CP violation and the statistical significance of these regions.
            Skills used in this project include: scientific programming, including non-linear curve fitting (the most complicated model used fitted 5 curves simultaneously), numpy and matplotlib; basic particle physics knowledge; statistical analysis of, for example, fitting models and uncertainties.
          </dd>

          <dt class="col-sm-3">Monte Carlo simulation of neutron penetration <a href="/project3_10331083.html">Read notebook</a></dt>
          <dd class="col-sm-9">
            Second year computational physics project investigating the penetration of fast neutrons into various materials using Monte Carlo techniques.
            The simulation simulated the transmission properties neutron shielders, such as water and lead.
            A statistical analysis of each simulation was performed to estimate the uncertainties on each of the rates measured: transmission, reflection, and absorption.
            The Woodcock tracking method was also implemented to test cases of composite materials.

        <h2>Machine learning</h2>
        <p>
          I have self-studied the first edition of "Deep Learning with Python" by Francois Chollet and am currently in the process of working through the second edition. I have tested my skills on some famous computer vision problems on Kaggle (chest x-rays, galaxy zoo).
          I next intend to learn how to use decision trees and gradient boosting libraries to give myself a more well-rounding understanding of different machine learning methods.
        </p>
        <h2>Game development</h2>
        <p>
          I am a hobbyist game developer, specialising in the Godot engine. At the moment I am self-teaching myself the principles of games design by recreating simple games, such as bloons tower defense, in Godot. My long-term ambition is to develop a 3D game based around stopping a dog you are looking after from getting into trouble.
        </p>
        <h2>Teaching</h2>
        <p>
          I tutor A level physics and maths, and KS3 to GCSE science and maths. I currently have around 150 hours of tuition under my belt across many age groups, abilities and group sizes (one-on-one to groups of up to three).
