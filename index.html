          Welcome to my personal projects site! Here are some of the computing projects that I have worked on during my undergraduate physics degree at the University of Manchester.
        </p>
        <h2>Physics</h2>
        <dl class="row">
          <dt class="col-sm-3">Matter-antimatter asymmetries at the LHC</dt>
          <dd class="col-sm-9">Third year lab investigating the CP violation of the weak decay of the B meson.</dd>

          <dt class="col-sm-3">Monte Carlo simulation of neutron penetration</dt>
          <dd class="col-sm-9">Second year computational physics project investigating the penetration of fast neutrons into various materials using Monte Carlo techniques.</dd>
        </dl>
        <h2>Machine learning</h2>
        <p>
          I have self-studied the first edition of "Deep Learning with Python" by Francois Chollet and am currently in the process of working through the second edition. I have tested my skills on some famous computer vision problems on Kaggle (chest x-rays, galaxy zoo).
          I next intend to learn how to use decision trees and gradient boosting libraries to give myself a more well-rounding understanding of different machine learning methods.
        </p>
        <h2>Other</h2>
        <p>
          I tutor A level physics and maths, and KS3 to GCSE science and maths. I currently have around 150 hours of tuition under my belt across many age groups, abilities and group sizes (one-on-one to groups of up to three).
